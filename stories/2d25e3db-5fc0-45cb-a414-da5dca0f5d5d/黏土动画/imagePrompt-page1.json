In the vast, dark expanse of deep space, a brilliant, perfectly round moon dominates the frame, its surface rendered with subtle, textured clay craters. Upon its surface, nestled among swirling, thick clay clouds, stands the grand and ethereal Guanghan Palace, crafted with intricate clay details like carved eaves and layered walls. Adjacent to the palace, a colossal osmanthus tree, its trunk massive and gnarled with rich clay textures, reaches towards the distant stars. Its branches are dense with vibrant green leaves and clusters of tiny, fragrant yellow osmanthus flowers, depicted with fine, delicate clay applications. A delicate, translucent haze of sweet fragrance subtly emanates from the tree, visually depicted as soft, swirling clay tendrils that pierce through the clouds. The overall atmosphere is one of serene grandeur and mystical beauty, rendered in a detailed Claymation art style with soft, diffused moonlight that highlights the rich textures and handcrafted feel characteristic of clay modeling. Dynamic composition with the tree and palace framed against the vast cosmic backdrop.",
