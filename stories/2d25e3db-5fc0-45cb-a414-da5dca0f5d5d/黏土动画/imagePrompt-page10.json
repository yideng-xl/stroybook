  "imagePrompt": "A majestic wide shot, a final 'hero shot,' of Wu Gang perpetually engaged in his task, but now embodying serene transcendence. He stands at the base of the colossal osmanthus tree, his robust figure a harmonious and integral part of the grand lunar landscape. His axe strokes are rhythmic and calm, his posture upright and radiating deep peace. His stylized expression conveys profound tranquility and wisdom, entirely devoid of any past pain or struggle. The vibrant osmanthus tree, with its shining leaves and visible, fragrant clay tendrils gently wafting towards the viewer, stands as a testament to his eternal patience. The elegant Guanghan Palace and the vast, star-filled cosmos form a serene, encompassing backdrop. The scene radiates an atmosphere of eternal peace, harmony, and timeless patience, rendered in a detailed Claymation art style, with soft, ambient moonlight bathing the entire composition in a gentle, ethereal glow.",
