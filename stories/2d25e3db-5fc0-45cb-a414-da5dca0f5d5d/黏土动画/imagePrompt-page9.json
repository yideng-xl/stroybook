  "imagePrompt": "A dynamic low-angle 'hero shot' of Wu Gang mid-swing, embodying his profound realization and newfound purpose. His robust body is perfectly balanced, movements fluid and powerful, reflecting a deep understanding and harmonious connection to his task. The silver axe is captured at the peak of its arc, poised to strike, appearing almost as a seamless extension of his body. His posture conveys intense focus and a profound sense of being one with his environment. The giant osmanthus tree looms majestically above him, and the entire scene is bathed in a soft, ethereal light, subtly suggesting a spiritual transformation. Visual cues like subtle, swirling energy lines around his form and the axe emphasize his newfound mastery and enlightenment. The scene pulses with powerful, spiritual energy, rendered in a detailed Claymation art style, with dramatic lighting and dynamic composition to enhance the impact.",
