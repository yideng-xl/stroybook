Wu Gang's robust hand, with subtly raised clay veins, is seen actively pulling the silver axe from a freshly made gash in the osmanthus tree trunk. As the axe is withdrawn, the tree's clay bark visibly begins to ripple and flow, instantly mending the wound. The previously damaged area becomes smooth and pristine again, appearing as if untouched, with a subtle shimmer effect. Tiny, glistening clay beads of sweat are visible on Wu Gang's brow and arms, highlighting his intense physical strain in stark contrast to the tree's immediate and effortless regeneration. The scene emphasizes the frustrating and magical aspect of the task, captured in a detailed Claymation art style with clear, direct lighting that highlights the meticulous textures of the healing clay.",
