  "imagePrompt": "A wide shot depicting Wu Gang's profound frustration and defiance against his endless punishment. He stands at the base of the colossal tree, his robust figure framed against the vast, star-dotted lunar sky and the distant, serene Guanghan Palace. His head is tilted back, mouth slightly agape in a silent outcry (stylized, not realistic human expression), and his fists are clenched tightly at his sides. His entire body language conveys intense, raw anger and powerlessness, making him seem small against the cosmic backdrop. The silver axe lies discarded on the textured clay moon ground near his feet, reflecting his temporary abandonment of the task. The atmosphere is charged with anger and defiance, rendered in a detailed Claymation art style, using strong, directional moonlight to cast dramatic, elongated shadows, accentuating his emotional turmoil.",
