  "imagePrompt": "A dynamic medium close-up captures Wu Gang in motion, muscles visibly bulging and tensed under his simple clay attire as he swings the silver axe with immense, forceful momentum. The axe is depicted mid-impact, deeply embedded into the thick, gnarled, textured clay trunk of the osmanthus tree. The moment of impact is emphasized by subtle visual cues: tiny clay dust particles scattering from the strike point and distinct, concentric ripple effects in the clay tree bark, conveying a resonant 'thud' sound. Wu Gang's entire body is tensed with extreme effort, his posture demonstrating the full exertion of his power. The scene is charged with an impactful and repetitive energy, rendered in a detailed Claymation art style, with strong side lighting emphasizing his robust form and the rich texture of the tree.",
