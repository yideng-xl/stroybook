Withered, brown clay plants and parched ground dominate the foreground, emphasizing the widespread suffering. In a small, contrasting corner of the frame, slightly out of the direct harsh light, 后羿 (Hou Yi) stands calmly, a robust male figure wearing traditional ancient Chinese attire with a powerful bow and quiver, his posture serene. Beside him, 嫦娥 (Chang'e), a graceful female figure in an elegant, flowing traditional Chinese dress, exhibits a gentle demeanor. Their small, peaceful abode in the background is a simple, humble clay structure. The overall atmosphere is one of initial devastating calamity contrasted with a hint of quiet strength and impending change. Rich details include heat distortion effects around the suns and the texture of dry, parched clay.",
