  "imagePrompt": "An epic, sweeping long shot in the distinctive claymation art style, depicting a melancholic ascent. 嫦娥 (Chang'e), the graceful female figure, is shown floating upwards, her flowing traditional dress billowing around her, with subtle trails of ethereal light emanating from her form. She gracefully passes through an open window of her distant, shrinking home, which is visible far below. Her body language conveys a sense of profound longing and sorrow, as if looking back at what she is leaving behind. Above her, the vast, deep blue clay night sky is filled with twinkling, stylized clay stars. The dominant feature of the sky is a large, luminous, benevolent full moon, towards which Chang'e is gracefully ascending. The composition uses strong vertical lines and a sense of upward motion, guiding the viewer's eye from the small earthly dwelling to the magnificent lunar destination. The atmosphere is magical, sorrowful, and grand, highlighting her solitary, destined journey.",
