  "imagePrompt": "A low-angle medium shot in the distinctive claymation art style, creating a sense of foreboding. The scene is set inside 后羿 (Hou Yi)'s home, but it is now cast in deep, unsettling shadows, with only slivers of light illuminating key areas. 蓬蒙 (Peng Meng), the lean, somewhat sinister male figure in darker traditional attire, is shown in a hunched, sneaking posture, his body language exuding cunning and ill intent. He is carefully prying open a window or door, peeking into the interior, his presence an intrusion. A single, glinting clay eye (stylized for claymation) or a subtle shadow across his brow conveys his malevolent purpose without resorting to explicit human facial expressions. The overall atmosphere is suspenseful, dark, and filled with a sense of impending danger. Rich details include the texture of the shadowy clay walls and floor, enhancing the clandestine feel.",
