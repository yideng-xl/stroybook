The setting is intimate, with simple clay furniture and soft, natural lighting. 后羿 (Hou Yi), the robust male figure, is shown with careful, deliberate movements. His hands are delicately placing the glowing, crystalline elixir inside a sturdy, intricately carved wooden treasure chest. The chest, crafted from textured clay to mimic wood, is partially open, revealing a soft, fabric-like clay lining. Hou Yi's posture and the gentle way his hands handle the elixir convey deep affection and a pensive mood, suggesting his reluctance to part from 嫦娥. The atmosphere is one of domestic tenderness mixed with a subtle undercurrent of a significant, hidden secret.",
