  "imagePrompt": "A dynamic medium shot in the distinctive claymation art style, capturing a tense confrontation. 嫦娥 (Chang'e), the graceful female figure in her flowing traditional dress, stands protectively over the open, carved wooden treasure chest, her arms tightly cradling it. Her posture is one of fierce determination and defiance. Opposite her, 蓬蒙 (Peng Meng), the lean, sinister male figure, brandishes a stylized clay sword with a menacing, aggressive stance, its blade catching a glint of light. His body is leaning forward, indicating a forceful demand. The lighting is dramatic, casting strong shadows to heighten the tension, with a spotlight effect on Chang'e and the chest to emphasize their vulnerability and her protective role. The atmosphere is charged with high tension, desperation, and imminent danger.",
