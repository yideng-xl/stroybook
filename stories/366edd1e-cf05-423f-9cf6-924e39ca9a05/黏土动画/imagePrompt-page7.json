  "imagePrompt": "A tight, dynamic close-up in the distinctive claymation art style, capturing a pivotal moment of desperate action. The focus is on 嫦娥 (Chang'e), the graceful female figure, as she swiftly brings the glowing, crystalline elixir to her mouth, her body language conveying urgency and a last-resort decision. Her eyes are wide with a mix of shock and resolve. In the foreground, just inches away, the reaching hand of 蓬蒙 (Peng Meng), the sinister male figure, is outstretched, grasping but narrowly missing the elixir, his fingers splayed in a desperate attempt. As the elixir enters Chang'e's body, a subtle, ethereal light begins to emanate from her form, suggesting an immediate internal transformation. The composition uses a slightly tilted angle to enhance the drama and immediacy of the scene. The atmosphere is sudden, desperate, and filled with a sense of magical, irreversible change.",
