  "imagePrompt": "A dynamic, heroic long shot in the distinctive claymation art style. 后羿 (Hou Yi), the robust male figure, is captured mid-action atop a towering, jagged peak of Kunlun Mountain, its clay surface textured and majestic. He is in a powerful stance, drawing his mighty bow, an arrow nocked and ready. In the sky above, nine fiery suns are depicted in various stages of dissipating, with brilliant light trails suggesting their descent, while one benevolent sun remains. Below, the previously scorched earth is visibly transforming, patches of vibrant green clay foliage and flowing blue clay rivers emerging, symbolizing renewed life. The composition uses leading lines from the mountain peaks and the trajectory of the arrows to guide the eye towards Hou Yi, emphasizing his central role and the epic scale of his feat. The lighting is dramatic, with strong highlights on Hou Yi and the remaining sun, and a triumphant, hopeful atmosphere.",
